# Event Manager

This particular tutorial is a brief introduction to working with a CSV file and utilizing data to work with Google's Civic Information API. Additionally, Embedded Ruby is used for templating. 

This is a modified tutorial as part of [a project from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/event-manager-ruby-programming). Due to the nature of tutorials, not all of it is my original code. My assigned tasks were to: add standardized phone numbers, find the peak registration hour(s) and find the peak regsitration day(s) of the week.
